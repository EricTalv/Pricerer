###### A product price comparing service 

## Project Task 
The task was to create a project and putting more focus on teamwork and workflow, 
to divide and organize work.

## Idea 
The idea of this project was to create a service which in which you can 
look for products across many multiple shopping chains and with our filtering methods
you could see how each item would compare on each shopping chain.

This would allow clients to seek for products which might not be available in every 
shopping chain, our tool will search each shop for it OR ofcourse the main usage would
also to find the best deals across the shopping chains. 

## Work Flow 
Our work flow would be divided as follows: 

| Frontend      | Backend            | Shop APIS  |
| ------------- |:------------------:| -----:|
| Design        | Data server        | Shops List |
| Data fetching | Data Sender        |       |
|               | Data reciever      |       |

We had a Frontend team which was also divided into 2, where
one would fully work on web Design and UX,
the second developer would work on fetching data to the page, 
placing the data into elements and also Coding Design and UX together.

Our back end would fully rely on API calls so we decided we are gonna have a seperate
Database server, and we would have a middle api that will ask for data from that server
and then serve it to our frontend team.

Shop APIS was a big issue, many shopping chains dont have their database 
open For API's thus we needed to have a smaller team whom would craft ways of 
getting data from shopping chains.

We would also experimented with web scraping and creating an automated system of 
fetching and filtering products from shops and sending them over to our database server.

## Learning points

The main idea was to learn how to work in a team environment thus we learned 
alot on organizing, workflow, workassignment.

We experimented with many third-party organizing tools and also Git's 
included workspaces, tried out many different workflow managment methods

## Tools

Our project used:

1. Nuxt ( Vuetify )
2. Laravel ( Axios )
3. GitHub
4. GitLab 
5. PostMan 

Our projects architecture was based on Nuxt and Laravel,
we initially used GitLab since it had some extra integrated functions,
gitHub was my preference and this also allowed seeing how a project could be
spread over to git spaces.

Both gitHub and GitLab provided their advantages, GitHub with its 
project space provided a neat workflow management station and GitLab with its
integrated code linting and other tools.

Postman ofcourse was used for craftin API's

## Conclusion

The project was a good success in the sense that it introduced more to a 
team workflow kind of environment and also let us see the world of API's.

The product itself ofcourse Works but not in its entirety, since the 
scope of the product had become so much bigger thus our timeline started to get 
cramped even more so thus thanks to time and team size we'd fall short
from our initial product idea.

## Personal

My personal experitse would lie in workflow management and also 
frontend design and coding, yeah its multiple things on one person but thats
the budget cuts we had to do at the time, due to the small team size. 

Overall it was a great time developing with other great minds.
